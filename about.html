KA-playlist is a free web-app meant to help educators to help their students prepare for class with Khan Academy. It is based on the <a class="extLink" href="https://api-explorer.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy api</a>. 
<br><br>
The idea behind this tool is that you can create a custom curriculum of prerequisites that will ensure incoming students are prepared to take on your course material.
<div class="pageTitle">Examples</div>
Teaching astronomy? Maybe your students need to brush up on some rudimentary physics or chemistry concepts so that you can focus on actually teaching astronomy.
<br><br>
Teaching poly-sci? Maybe there's a good history lesson that your students can familiarize themselves with before you meet to discuss present times.
<br><br>
Your custom playlist can help students to prepare at home for more meaningful discussions during the more precious limited class time.
<div class="pageTitle">Why</div>
This concept was developed when a <a class="extLink" href="http://alexwyrick.com/about.html">design student</a> wanted to take the acclaimed <a class="extLink" href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Stanford machine learning</a> course online. He needed to brush-up on math, but what parts of math? Khan academy offers thousands of videos organized on math but he didn’t know where to begin.
<br><br>
After crawling Khan Academy for some time, I found <a class="extLink" href="https://khanacademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/201466174-Create-custom-missions">in the forums</a> that many educators were looking for this...
<br>
<div class="pageTitle">What educators are saying:</div>
"I'd like to be able to hand-pick skills and create my own custom "mission" that would represent what I need my students to learn this year.”<br>
- Charles Garand
<br><br>
"I'm sure this is a problem that is currently stopping many people in the UK from using KA in school…”<br>
- Cornish Calculator
<br><br>
"Yes!  Totally agree.  This would make it my number one tool in the tutoring program I coordinate.”<br>
- Erica Butler
<br><br>
"I don't quite understand why this is not an option, unless they plan on releasing it later as paid add on. I would pay for it by the way!”<br>
- Jccook
<br><br>
"I would love to have the capabilities of pre-selecting skills to put within a mission. If I was able to do this, I could also use Khan more effectively with my students on an Individualized Education Plan.”<br>
- Mr. Campbell
<br><br>
"Khan Academy has a lot of great pre-existing content and playlist.  It would be beneficial for some teachers/coaches however to be able to create custom playlist for students.  This would allow coaches to not have to recommend the same subset of skills/videos to students working on similar material but to just recommend the playlist.  It may even be nice to allow other members to vote on playlist that are useful.”<br>
- Joe Neilson
<div class="pageTitle">Next</div>
Future versions of this app could plug into the <a class="extLink" href="https://api-explorer.khanacademy.org/">api oAuth tools</a> so that teachers could assign custom playlists, track student progress and create custom badges for completion. I think a rating system could also be interesting so better (user-approved) content can be made more visible.
